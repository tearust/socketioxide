//! Socketioxide is a socket.io server implementation that works as a [`tower`] layer/service.
//! It integrates nicely with the rest of the [`tower`]/[`tokio`]/[`hyper`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/) ecosystem.

//! ## Features
//! * Easy to use flexible axum-like API
//! * Fully compatible with the official [socket.io client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/)
//! * Support for the previous version of the protocol (v4).
//! * State Management
//! * Namespaces
//! * Rooms
//! * Acknowledgements
//! * Polling & Websocket transports
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//! Because it works as a tower [`layer`](tower::layer)/[`service`](tower::Service) or an hyper [`service`](hyper::service::Service)
//! you can use it with any http server frameworks that works with tower/hyper:
//! * [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/)
//! * [Warp](https://docs.rs/warp/latest/warp/) (Not supported with socketioxide >= 0.9.0 as long as warp doesn't migrate to hyper v1)
//! * [Hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/)
//! * [Salvo](https://docs.rs/salvo/latest/salvo/)
//!
//! Check the [examples](http://github.com/totodore/socketioxide/tree/main/examples) for more details on frameworks integration.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! The API tries to mimic the equivalent JS API as much as possible. The main difference is that the default namespace `/` is not created automatically, you need to create it manually.
//!
//! ## Initialisation
//! The [`SocketIo`] struct is the main entry point of the library. It is used to create a [`Layer`](tower::layer) or a [`Service`](tower::Service).
//! Later it can be used as the equivalent of the `io` object in the JS API.
//!
//! When creating your [`SocketIo`] instance, you can use the builder pattern to configure it with the [`SocketIoBuilder`] struct.
//! * See the [`SocketIoBuilder`] doc for more details on the available configuration options.
//! * See the [`layer`] module doc for more details on layers.
//! * See the [`service`] module doc for more details on services.
//!
//! #### Tower layer example with custom configuration:
//! ```
//! use socketioxide::SocketIo;
//! let (layer, io) = SocketIo::builder()
//!     .max_payload(10_000_000) // Max HTTP payload size of 10M
//!     .max_buffer_size(10_000) // Max number of packets in the buffer
//!     .build_layer(None);
//! ```
//!
//! #### Tower _standalone_ service example with default configuration:
//! ```
//! use socketioxide::SocketIo;
//! let (svc, io) = SocketIo::new_svc(None);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Handlers
//! Handlers are functions or clonable closures that are given to the `io.ns`, the `socket.on` and the `socket.on_disconnect` fns.
//! They can be async or sync and can take from 0 to 16 arguments that implements the [`FromConnectParts`](handler::FromConnectParts)
//! trait for the [`ConnectHandler`](handler::ConnectHandler), the [`FromMessageParts`](handler::FromMessageParts) for
//! the [`MessageHandler`](handler::MessageHandler) and the [`FromDisconnectParts`](handler::FromDisconnectParts) for
//! the [`DisconnectHandler`](handler::DisconnectHandler).
//! They are greatly inspired by the axum handlers.
//!
//! If they are async, a new task will be spawned for each incoming connection/message so it doesn't block the event management task.
//!
//! * Check the [`handler::connect`] module doc for more details on the connect handler
//! * Check the [`handler::message`] module doc for more details on the message handler.
//! * Check the [`handler::disconnect`] module doc for more details on the disconnect handler.
//! * Check the [`handler::extract`] module doc for more details on the extractors.
//!
//! ## Extractors
//! Handlers params are called extractors and are used to extract data from the incoming connection/message. They are inspired by the axum extractors.
//! An extractor is a struct that implements the [`FromConnectParts`](handler::FromConnectParts) trait for the [`ConnectHandler`](handler::ConnectHandler)
//! the [`FromMessageParts`](handler::FromMessageParts) for the [`MessageHandler`](handler::MessageHandler) and the
//! [`FromDisconnectParts`](handler::FromDisconnectParts) for the [`DisconnectHandler`](handler::DisconnectHandler).
//!
//! Here are some examples of extractors:
//! * [`Data`](extract::Data): extracts and deserialize to json any data, if a deserialize error occurs the handler won't be called
//!     - for [`ConnectHandler`](handler::ConnectHandler): extracts and deserialize to json the auth data
//!     - for [`MessageHandler`](handler::MessageHandler): extracts and deserialize to json the message data
//! * [`TryData`](extract::Data): extracts and deserialize to json any data but with a `Result` type in case of error
//!     - for [`ConnectHandler`](handler::ConnectHandler): extracts and deserialize to json the auth data
//!     - for [`MessageHandler`](handler::MessageHandler): extracts and deserialize to json the message data
//! * [`SocketRef`](extract::Data): extracts a reference to the [`Socket`](socket::Socket)
//! * [`Bin`](extract::Data): extract a binary payload for a given message. Because it consumes the event it should be the last argument
//! * [`AckSender`](extract::Data): Can be used to send an ack response to the current message event
//! * [`ProtocolVersion`]: extracts the protocol version of the socket
//! * [`TransportType`]: extracts the transport type of the socket
//! * [`DisconnectReason`](crate::socket::DisconnectReason): extracts the reason of the disconnection
//! * [`State`](extract::State): extracts a reference to a state previously set with [`SocketIoBuilder::with_state`](crate::io::SocketIoBuilder).
//! ### Extractor order
//! Extractors are run in the order of their declaration in the handler signature. If an extractor returns an error, the handler won't be called and a `tracing::error!` call will be emitted if the `tracing` feature is enabled.
//!
//! For the [`MessageHandler`](handler::MessageHandler), some extractors require to _consume_ the event and therefore only implement the [`FromMessage`](handler::FromMessage) trait, like the [`Bin`](extract::Bin) extractor, therefore they should be the last argument.
//!
//! Note that any extractors that implement the [`FromMessageParts`](handler::FromMessageParts) also implement by default the [`FromMessage`](handler::FromMessage) trait.
//!
//! ## Events
//! There are three types of events:
//! * The connect event is emitted when a new connection is established. It can be handled with the [`ConnectHandler`](handler::ConnectHandler) and the `io.ns` method.
//! * The message event is emitted when a new message is received. It can be handled with the [`MessageHandler`](handler::MessageHandler) and the `socket.on` method.
//! * The disconnect event is emitted when a socket is closed. It can be handled with the [`DisconnectHandler`](handler::DisconnectHandler) and the `socket.on_disconnect` method.
//!
//! Only one handler can exist for an event so registering a new handler for an event will replace the previous one.
//!
//! ## [Emiting data](#emiting-data)
//! Data can be emitted to a socket with the [`Socket::emit`](socket::Socket) method. It takes an event name and a data argument.
//! The data argument can be any type that implements the [`serde::Serialize`] trait.
//!
//! You can emit from the [`SocketIo`] handle or the [`SocketRef`](extract::SocketRef).
//! The difference is that you can move the [`io`](SocketIo) handle everywhere because it is a cheaply cloneable struct.
//! The [`SocketRef`](extract::SocketRef) is a reference to the socket and cannot be cloned.
//!
//! Moreover the [`io`](SocketIo) handle can emit to any namespace while the [`SocketRef`](extract::SocketRef) can only emit to the namespace of the socket.
//!
//! #### Emit errors
//! If the data can't be serialized to json, an [`serde_json::Error`] will be returned.
//! If the socket is disconnected or the internal channel is full, a tracing log will be emitted if the `tracing` feature is enabled and the message will be dropped.
//! This solution is not ideal and will be improved in the future (see [socketioxide/172](https://github.com/Totodore/socketioxide/issues/172)).
//!
//! #### Emitting with operators
//! To configure the emit, you can chain [`Operators`](operators::Operators) methods to the emit call. With that you can easily configure the following options:
//! * rooms: emit, join, leave to specific rooms
//! * namespace: emit to a specific namespace (only from the [`SocketIo`] handle)
//! * timeout: set a custom timeout when waiting for an ack
//! * binary: emit a binary payload with the message
//! * local: broadcast only to the current node (in case of a cluster)
//!
//! Check the [`operators::Operators`] doc for more details on the operators.
//!
//! ## Acknowledgements
//! You can ensure that a message has been received by the client/server with acknowledgements.
//!
//! #### Server acknowledgements
//! They are implemented with the [`AckSender`](extract::AckSender) extractor.
//! You can send an ack response with an optional binary payload with the [`AckSender::send`](extract::AckSender) method.
//! If the client doesn't send an ack response, the [`AckSender::send`](extract::AckSender) method will do nothing.
//!
//! #### Client acknowledgements
//! You can use the [`Socket::emit_with_ack`](socket::Socket) method to emit a message with an ack callback.
//! It will return a [`Future`](futures::Future) that will resolve when the acknowledgement is received.
//!
//! ## [State management](#state-management)
//! There are two ways to manage the state of the server:
//!
//! #### Per socket state
//! You can enable the `extensions` feature and use the [`extensions`](socket::Socket::extensions) field on any socket to manage
//! the state of each socket. It is backed by a [`dashmap`] so you can safely access it from multiple threads.
//! Beware that deadlocks can easily occur if you hold a value ref and try to remove it at the same time.
//! See the [`extensions`] module doc for more details.
//!
//! #### Global state
//! You can enable the `state` feature and use [`SocketIoBuilder::with_state`](SocketIoBuilder) method to set
//! multiple global states for the server. You can then access them from any handler with the [`State`](extract::State) extractor.
//!
//! Because the global state is staticaly defined, beware that the state map will exist for the whole lifetime of the program even
//! if you drop everything and close you socket.io server. This is a limitation because of the impossibility to have extractors with lifetimes,
//! therefore state references must be `'static`.
//!
//! Another limitation is that because it is common to the whole server. If you build a second server, it will share the same state.
//! Also if the first server is already started you won't be able to add new states because states are frozen at the start of the first server.
//!
//! ## Adapters
//! This library is designed to work with clustering. It uses the [`Adapter`](adapter::Adapter) trait to abstract the underlying storage.
//! By default it uses the [`LocalAdapter`](adapter::LocalAdapter) which is a simple in-memory adapter.
//! Currently there is no other adapters available but more will be added in the future.
//!
//! ## [Feature flags](#feature-flags)
//! * `v4`: enable support for the socket.io protocol v4
//! * `tracing`: enable logging with [`tracing`] calls
//! * `extensions`: enable per-socket state with the [`extensions`] module
//! * `state`: enable global state management
